            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>In 2024, the group announced a bold new brand identity that unites all our colleges under one logo. 
                City and Islington College, The College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London, and Westminster Kingsway College, 
                will operate under the shared identity of Capital City College. Capital City College Training will operate under a new brand identity of Apprenticeships+.
            </p>
            <p>The fresh new logos are a symbol of our shared mission, with the segments in the letter “C” representing both our diverse community and our different centres of excellence across London. 
                This rebranding reflects our commitment to providing high-quality education and training across London while celebrating the strength of our unity and diversity.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the new group logo, several of our centres will also be adopting new names to align more closely with their locations, ensuring a cohesive identity across the group. 
                By using centre locations as the foundation for these names, we are creating a clearer and more unified brand presence while still honouring the distinctiveness of each site.

            <h1>Safeguarding</h1>
            <p>
                Safeguarding is the term used when talking about protecting vulnerable adults and young people from abuse or neglect. 
                Across all of our colleges, we are committed to ensuring that every member of staff is safeguarding-trained to help ensure 
                our college is a safe place for your child to study.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have a dedicated safeguarding team who leads all safeguarding matters at each college. 
                Every member of staff in our group is trained and inducted in Safeguarding procedures. 
                You can find details of our safeguarding teams by visiting each of our college websites.

                Capital City College is the trading name of Capital City College Group, 
                and is an independent corporation with exempt charity status formed under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.
